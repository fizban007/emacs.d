#+TITLE: Unified Emacs Init Description
#+AUTHOR: Alex Chen

* Introduction
This is a new effort to making a unified and portable Emacs init
configuration using org-mode. The idea is to have a simple =emacs.el=
in =.emacs.d= directory, while tangling all the components from this
single file. At the same time, this file will act as a documentation
of whatever is going into the =emacs.el= init file.

* General Settings
The settings here are independent of any external packages, but rather
how Emacs itself behaves. They are added here before any
package-specific settings because these are more general. However, the
generalness is somewhat subjective here, and some of the settings
might be better suited elsewhere? Time is needed to decide such things.

** Lexical binding
Emacs used to not have lexical binding, and everything has dynamic
scope (read: global scope). As of Emacs 24, lexical binding can be
turned on for a specific buffer by the following line at the beginning
of the file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
#+END_SRC

The comparison of lexical vs dynamic binding is summarized pretty well
in [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DynamicBindingVsLexicalBinding][this article]] on Emacs wiki. In general dynamic binding is dispised
by most programmers, and people quote this as one of the weaknesses of
Emacs-lisp. Therefore it is desirable to have this line at the
beginning of our init.el

** Personal Settings
First things first. These settings are basically "who-i-am" and
"where-i-am" settings and independent of any external packages. I just
want to put them here and have them out of the way. The content of the
settings are pretty self-explanatory.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "Alex Chen")
(setq user-mail-address "fizban007@gmail.com")
(setq user-organization "Columbia University")

(set-language-environment "English")

(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
#+END_SRC

** Convenience Settings
Here are some settings which are generally good but somehow is not
turned on by default in vanilla Emacs (one of the reasons why
beginners starting with Emacs find it a monster to use).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Change the yes or no dialog to y or n
  (defalias 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)

  ;; Don't create backup-files
  (setq make-backup-files nil) ; stop creating those backup~ files
  (setq auto-save-default nil) ; stop creating those #auto save# files

  ;; Disable annoying startup-stuff
  (setq inhibit-startup-message t
        inhibit-startup-echo-area-message t)

  ;; Isearch put you at the beginning of the word
  (add-hook 'isearch-mode-end-hook 'my-goto-match-beginning)
  (defun my-goto-match-beginning () 
    (when isearch-forward (goto-char isearch-other-end)))

  ;; scroll one line at a time (less "jumpy" than defaults)
  (setq mouse-wheel-scroll-amount '(1 ((shift) . 1))) ;; one line at a time
  (setq mouse-wheel-progressive-speed nil) ;; don't accelerate scrolling
  (setq mouse-wheel-follow-mouse 't) ;; scroll window under mouse
  (setq scroll-step 1) ;; keyboard scroll one line at a time
  (setq scroll-conservatively 10000)

  ;; when pasting with middle click in Linux X11, set to paste at cursor
  ;; position, not at click position
  (setq mouse-yank-at-point t)

  ;; Find file as root
  (defun find-file-as-root ()
    "Like `ido-find-file, but automatically edit the file with
    root-privileges (using tramp/sudo), if the file is not writable by
    user."
    (interactive)
    (let ((file (read-file-name "Edit as root: ")))
      (unless (file-writable-p file)
        (setq file (concat "/sudo:root@localhost:" file)))
      (find-file file)))
  ;; or some other keybinding...
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x F") 'find-file-as-root)

  ;; Use C-x C-e to evaluate region
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-e") 'eval-region)

  ;; Pane manipulation

  (global-set-key (kbd "M-5") 'split-window-vertically) ; split pane top/bottom
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-4") 'split-window-horizontally) ; split pane top/bottom
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-3") 'delete-window) ; close current pane

  ;; Garbage collection, prevent gc for a longer period of time
  (setq gc-cons-threshold 20000000)

  ;; Auto revert buffers which are modified elsewhere
  (global-auto-revert-mode 1)

  ;; Don't save kill-ring to the x clipboard. This avoids some error at exit
  (setq x-select-enable-clipboard-manager nil) 

  ;; Don't produce an additional window for Ediff, but keep it in the same frame
  (setq ediff-window-setup-function 'ediff-setup-windows-plain)
  (setq ediff-split-window-function 'split-window-horizontally)
  ;; When you quit an Ediff session with q, it just leaves the two diff
  ;; windows around, instead of restoring the window configuration from
  ;; when Ediff was started. Here's the (slightly hacky) code to restore
  ;; the old window configuration:
  (winner-mode)
  (add-hook 'ediff-after-quit-hook-internal 'winner-undo)

  ;; wrap email body
  (add-hook 'mail-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)

  ;; Searches ignore case
  (setq case-fold-search t)
#+END_SRC

=ibuffer= is a built-in command in Emacs since Emacs 22. It is a
drastically improved buffer list such that there is no reason to use
the old one anymore. However, somehow the default is still the ugly
old buffer list. We rebind it here
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'ibuffer)
;; iBuffer binding
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-b") 'ibuffer)
#+END_SRC

This block makes the "beginning of line" of vanilla Emacs smarter. It
is taken from [[http://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/05/22/smarter-navigation-to-the-beginning-of-a-line/][here]].
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun smarter-move-beginning-of-line (arg)

point reaches the beginning or end of the buffer, stop there."
  (interactive "^p")
  (setq arg (or arg 1))

  ;; Move lines first
  (when (/= arg 1)
    (let ((line-move-visual nil))
      (forward-line (1- arg))))

  (let ((orig-point (point)))
    (back-to-indentation)
    (when (= orig-point (point))
      (move-beginning-of-line 1))))

;; remap C-a to `smarter-move-beginning-of-line'
(global-set-key [remap move-beginning-of-line]
                'smarter-move-beginning-of-line)
#+END_SRC

This short block checks whether the file under edit contains a
shebang, and if yes, makes it executable.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

  'executable-make-buffer-file-executable-if-script-p)
#+END_SRC

The variable redisplay-dont-pause, when set to t, will cause Emacs to fully redraw the display before it processes queued input events. This may have slight performance implications if you’re aggressively mouse scrolling a document or rely on your keyboard’s auto repeat feature. For most of us, myself included, it’s probably a no-brainer to switch it on.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq redisplay-dont-pause t)
#+END_SRC

* Package Repositories
First we need to set up some package repositories to establish a
consistent way to get packages. We use the official gnu repo, as well
as the third-party melpa and marmalade repos. From [[http://toumorokoshi.github.io/emacs-from-scratch-part-2-package-management.html][this source]], the
difference between these two repos and the official repo is that:

+ melpa is a package archive managed by Milkypostman. It's the easiest
  package archive to add packages to, and is automatically updated
  when the package is. The go-to source for up to date, and the vast
  majority of, packages. However it's worth noting that with
  cutting-edge comes instability, so that is a risk of stability one
  should be aware of. It's worth noting I've never been broken for any
  package I've installed via melpa, however.

+ marmalade is another third-party package manager. Marmalade tends to
  be more stable, due to the requirement that developers explicitely
  upload new versions of their packages.
 
The general trend is that for stability gnu > marmalade > melpa, while
for cutting-edgedness melpa > marmalade > gnu. From Emacs 24.4, the
package manager allows the user to specify which version to install
when there are several different versions of the same package on
different repos. This comes in rather handy for someone who wants to
prefer some package to be stable while others being cutteng-edge.

Package management is done through the official =package.el=.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'package)

(add-to-list 'package-archives '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/"))

(package-initialize)
#+END_SRC

After =(package-initialize)= all the directories under
=~/.emacs.d/elpa= will be added to the load-path, and therefore the
packages accessible from Emacs. Most of the other packages will no
longer need to set their load-path anymore.

** List of essential packages
Here we define a list of essential packages that we can't live
without. After package archives are initialized, Emacs will go through
this list and install any package in this list which is missing from
the system. Note that since this is the first time we define this
global variable, =defvar= is the correct command to use instead of
=setq=, which is supposed to set variables instead of creating them.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC

This is a really long list for "essential" packages. However it is
hard to slim it down because so many of them are useful. At least we
have a central way of dealing with packages. Local installations can
play around and install new packages, and when I find a new package to
be important enough I'll add it to this list. I'll also /try/ to
update this list periodically by removing packages that I don't find
much use.

Now with =my-required-packages= defined, we need to install these
packages if they are not already in the system. The following code is
copied from [[http://toumorokoshi.github.io/emacs-from-scratch-part-2-package-management.html][here]].
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'cl)

; method to check if all packages are installed
(defun packages-installed-p ()
  (loop for p in my-required-packages
        when (not (package-installed-p p)) do (return nil)
        finally (return t)))

; if not all packages are installed, check one by one and install the missing ones.
(unless (packages-installed-p)
  ; check for new packages (package versions)
  (message "%s" "Emacs is now refreshing its package database...")
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (message "%s" " done.")
  ; install the missing packages
  (dolist (p my-required-packages)
    (when (not (package-installed-p p))
      (package-install p))))
#+END_SRC

The new function =packages-installed-p= checks if all the packages in
the list are installed by looping over the list and checking if every
package is installed by invoking =package-installed-p= which is
defined in =package.el=. Then the =unless= clause is carried out if
the predicate returns nil, in which case it will first refresh the
package contents, and then install any package which does not satisfy
=package-installed-p=.

The rest of this document is dedicated to loading and configuration of
these packages.

** Use-package macro
=use-package= is a package to simplify loading packages. Instead of
littering the init file with a huge number of =require= commands, one
can use the =use-package= command to selectively load packages and
defer their initialization until the package is actually needed. The
full documentation can be found on the [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][official website]].
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; The first line is to prevent problems with use-package
(require 'ert)
(require 'use-package)
#+END_SRC

* Look and Feel
This section loads themes and alters the looks of Emacs. To be honest,
vanilla Emacs looks like crap while it could have looked so much
better with just a few packages loaded. 

** Definitions
The default font I found to be best looking is Consolas. Others don't
even come close. It might be tricky to get a proper version of it
though, since it is propietary. This block tries to find Consolas in
the list of font families in the system. If it is found then we set it
as the default font for both the initial frame and any new frame that
Emacs creates.

Edit: This method has problems with =emacs --daemon= since if Emacs is
started in daemon mode then it will not see the font. Now the font is
mandatory and set to Consolas by default.

Edit: Want to take Menlo font for a spin. Although Menlo is a
propietary font, it can be found somewhere on the internet, and it
turns out to be really good. The letters are full and clear, and the
spacing are just right too.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; (add-to-list 'initial-frame-alist '(font . "Consolas for Powerline-10"))
  ;; (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . "Consolas for Powerline-10"))
  (add-to-list 'initial-frame-alist '(font . "Monaco-9"))
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . "Monaco-9"))
  ;; (defvar my-font-family "Consolas for Powerline")
  (defvar my-font-family "Monaco")
  ;; (add-to-list 'initial-frame-alist '(font . "Dejavu Sans Mono-9"))
  ;; (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . "Dejavu Sans Mono-9"))
  ;; (defvar my-font-family "Dejavu Sans Mono")
  (defvar my-font-size 90)
  (defvar my-theme 'solarized-dark)
  ;; (defvar my-theme 'lush)

  (defun my-load-theme (&optional frame)
    (load-theme my-theme t)
    ;; Remove modeline under and over lines
    (set-face-attribute
     'mode-line nil
     :underline nil
     :overline nil)
    (set-face-attribute
     'mode-line-inactive nil
     :underline nil
     :overline nil)
    )
#+END_SRC

** Tabbar-ruler
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq tabbar-ruler-global-tabbar t) ; If you want tabbar
  ;; (setq tabbar-ruler-global-ruler t) ; if you want a global ruler
  ;; (setq tabbar-ruler-popup-menu t) ; If you want a popup menu.
  ;; (setq tabbar-ruler-popup-toolbar t) ; If you want a popup toolbar
  ;; (setq tabbar-ruler-popup-scrollbar t) ; If you want to only show the
  ;;                                       ; scroll bar when your mouse is moving.
  (use-package tabbar-ruler
    :config
    (progn
      (tabbar-ruler-group-by-projectile-project)
      (global-set-key [\M-right] 'tabbar-ruler-tabbar-forward-tab)
      (global-set-key [\M-left] 'tabbar-ruler-tabbar-backward-tab)
      (setq tabbar-ruler-movement-timer-delay 1000000)
      (tabbar-install-faces)
    ))
#+END_SRC

** Theme
The best theme I have found up to now is Solarized. It comes in both
dark and light variants and while I prefer the dark version for most
of the time, the light version is useful when editting in some light
conditions. The following code loads =solarized-dark= as the default
theme.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; (defun my-reload-theme (frame)
    ;;   (select-frame frame)
    ;;   (my-load-theme frame))

    (if (daemonp)
        (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions
                  (lambda (frame)
                    (my-load-theme)))
      (my-load-theme))
#+END_SRC

Note that Solarized theme will require 24bit color support in
terminal, otherwise it is very difficult to get the same look-and-feel
even when the terminal is set to Solarized theme. In Emacs 24.4 there
seems to be built-in 24bit color support in terminals, but in prior
versions one might need to apply a patch. Note also that the terminal
application needs to support 24bit color. I'm using konsole right now
and it works great with terminal mode emacs.

** Smart mode line
The mode line is a very important part of Emacs, while often being the
most ugly part with some unexplicable symbols. The =smart-mode-line=
package revamps the mode line and makes it actually useful and more
pleasing to look at. Here is the config (note that this is our first
package config which uses =use-package=!)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package smart-mode-line
    :init
    (progn 
      (setq sml/theme 'dark)
      (setq sml/mode-width 'right)
      (setq sml/shorten-modes t)
      ;; (setq sml/theme 'respectful)
      (setq sml/no-confirm-load-theme t)
      (if after-init-time (sml/setup)
        (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'sml/setup))))
#+END_SRC

** Powerline
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
  ;; (use-package powerline)
  (require 'powerline)
  (require 'powerline-evil)
  (powerline-center-evil-theme)
#+END_SRC

** Tabbar
One of the things that I miss a lot going from Vim to Emacs is a tab
bar at the top of the screen showing the open buffers in the current
session. Now a tab bar is usually not sufficient to show all open
buffers and relying on the bar to find buffers is usually not the most
efficient way. However, when just browsing it still very useful to
easily keep track of what files are open without using =C-x b= every
time. The =tabbar= package solves this problem and is the best I've found.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (use-package tabbar
    :init
    (progn
      (tabbar-mode)
      ;; (tabbar-ruler-up)
      
      ;; Tabbar bindings
      (global-set-key [\M-left] 'tabbar-backward-tab)
      (global-set-key [\M-right] 'tabbar-forward-tab)
      (global-set-key [\M-up] 'tabbar-buffer)
      (global-set-key [\M-down] 'tabbar-forward-group)

      ;; Set tabbar faces
      (defun tabbar-install-faces (&optional frame)
        "Installs tabbar faces for a frame."
        (interactive)
        (copy-face 'mode-line 'tabbar-default frame)
        (copy-face 'default 'tabbar-selected frame)
        (copy-face 'shadow 'tabbar-unselected frame)
        (set-face-attribute 'tabbar-unselected frame
                            :background (face-attribute 'mode-line-inactive :background)
                            :box (:line-width 2))
        (set-face-attribute 'tabbar-selected frame
                            :box (:line-width 2))
        
        (copy-face 'mode-line-buffer-id 'tabbar-selected-highlight frame)
        (copy-face 'mode-line-inactive 'tabbar-unselected-highlight frame)
        
        (set-face-attribute 'tabbar-separator frame
                            :inherit 'tabbar-default
                            :box nil)
        
        (set-face-attribute 'tabbar-button frame
                            :inherit 'tabbar-default
                            :box nil))
      
      (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions 'tabbar-install-faces)
      (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook 'tabbar-install-faces)
      (tabbar-install-faces)
      ))
#+END_SRC

Note that when =evil-mode= is loaded, there is a couple more bindings
needed for tabbar. The config is [[tabbar-evil][here]].

** Line Numbers
The following block shows line numbers to the left of the buffer. It
is usually a good thing to have line numbers available to refer
to. I'm still not sure if =nlinum= or =linum= is better at displaying
the line numbers more efficiently. Here we use =linum=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package linum
    :init
    (progn
      ;;(nlinum-mode 1)
      ;; (line-number-mode 1)
      (global-linum-mode 1)
      ;;       (use-package linum-relative
      ;;         :ensure linum-relative)
      ))
#+END_SRC

** Colorizing Compilation Buffer
This setting enables ansi-color in compilation buffer. Very useful
especially with cmake generated makefiles.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq compilation-scroll-output 'first-error)
  
  (require 'ansi-color)
  (defun colorize-compilation-buffer ()
    (toggle-read-only)
    (ansi-color-apply-on-region (point-min) (point-max))
    (toggle-read-only))
  (add-hook 'compilation-filter-hook 'colorize-compilation-buffer)
#+END_SRC

** Other settings
Here are uncategorized visual settings, most of them trivial.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Hide the scroll bar
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)

  ;; Use C-c s to toggle visibility of scroll bar
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c s") 'scroll-bar-mode)

  ;; Hide the menu bar
  (menu-bar-mode -1)

  ;; Hide the toolbar
  (tool-bar-mode -1)

  ;; Display time in mode line
  (display-time)

  ;; Show matching brackets
  (show-paren-mode 1)

  ;; Highlighting TODO, FIXME and BUG in programming modes
  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (font-lock-add-keywords nil
                                      '(("\\<\\(FIXME\\|TODO\\|BUG\\):" 1 font-lock-warning-face t)))
              ))
#+END_SRC

* Org mode
Another mode which requires separate section is the powerful
org-mode. This is actually the mode which got me interested in Emacs
in the first place, and evetually became the reason I got converted
from Vim. There is simply no alternative which is so powerful and
customizable as Emacs's org-mode.

There are a lot of customizations here, most of them are years old and
I already forgot what they do. When I remember, I try to be specific
on what these customizations are, and when I don't remember, I'll try
to stick a marker to remind myself to come back and finish it.

** Init org-mode
Because org is so important, we want to load it when Emacs starts.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package org)
#+END_SRC

** Some generic customizations
These are some generic customizations which are hopefully

forgotten the source.

** Org-publish
Here we configure the publish engine of org-mode. Specifically we like
to publish in 2 formats: html and latex. For latex we need the
=ox-latex= package. In the following code block, we mostly define the
common latex packages to use and the org-latex preview format to use
when embedding latex directly into org-mode.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package ox-latex
    :config
    (progn 
      (add-to-list 'org-latex-packages-alist '("" "listings"))
      (add-to-list 'org-latex-packages-alist '("" "color"))
      (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes

We also want to use the html publish engine. This one is pretty
straight-forward and I don't have any customizations (mainly because I
seldom use it, and don't know html very much)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package ox-html)
#+END_SRC

Now these are the settings for publishing a specific org project: my
notes. It is under the =~/.org/notes= directory and I would like to
export both an html and a pdf version of it. Hence the following code
block for ox-publish:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package ox-publish
    :config
    (setq org-publish-project-alist
	  '(("notes-html"
	     :base-directory "~/.org/notes/"
	     :base-extension "org"
	     :publishing-directory "~/.org/notes/export/html"
	     :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
	     :section-numbers nil)
	    ("notes-pdf"
	     :base-directory "~/.org/notes/"
	     :base-extension "org"
	     :publishing-directory "~/.org/notes/export/pdf"
	     :publishing-function org-latex-publish-to-pdf)
	    ("notes" :components ("notes-html" "notes-pdf"))
	    )))

** Markdown Export
I'd like to add export to markdown mode for ease of writing a
README.md for github. Here is how
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC

** External agenda update
This function was taken from other blogs which solves the problem of
viewing org-mode agenda in an external program (in my case awesome
window manager). It basically writes the agenda to a text file every
time the agenda is updated. The function is kept for legacy reasons
and I've turned off this functionality for quite a long time.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun th-org-update-agenda-file (&optional force)
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (save-window-excursion
      (let ((file "~/.org/org-agenda.txt"))
        (org-agenda-list)
        (org-agenda-write file)))))
;; Update agenda file after changes to org files
;;   (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'th-org-update-agenda-file t t)
#+END_SRC

** Org-capture Settings
Org-capture is a system which allows the author to quickly add entries
to a (supposedly big) org file from anywhere within Emacs without
actually opening the file. It can be used to enter structured
information into an org file in an organized way, such as based on
date. Here are some of the templates I've accumulated over the years:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("t" "Todo" entry (file+headline "~/.org/newgtd.org" "Tasks")
         "* TODO %^{Brief Description}  %^g\n%?\nAdded: %U")
        ("n" "Notes" entry (file+datetree "~/.org/notes/notes.org")
         "* %^{Topic} \n%i%?\n") 
        ("b" "Birthday" plain (file+headline "~/.org/birthday.org" "Birthdays")
         "\%\%%?\(org-anniversary  %^{Date}\) %^{Name} would be \%d years old.\n")
        ("w" "Post" entry (file+datetree "~/org-jekyll/org/cyr.org")
         "* %^{Title}  :blog:\n  :PROPERTIES:\n  :on: %T\n  :END:\n  %?\n  %x")
        ("k" "Tricks" entry (file+datetree "~/.org/tricks.org" "Tricks")
         "* %^{Topic}  :tricks:\n  :PROPERTIES:\n  :on: %T\n  :END:\n  %?\n  %x")
        ))
#+END_SRC

** Misc Settings

                                  ))

* Evil mode
The =evil-mode= in Emacs is a package that simulates Vim behavior. It
is the best of its kind in that it almost fully simulates all of Vim's
behavior by adding a modal layer on top of Emacs's editing
facilities. It is purely because of this package that I successfully
made the transition from Vim to Emacs, and I suppose it is the same
story for many others as well. In fact, this has been proposed as the
solution to the old Emacs problem: "Emacs is a pretty good operating
system, but it could use a better text editor".

Therefore we dedicate a whole section in our config file to this
particular mode/package. Also since I use Colemak keyboard config,
there are quite a few things to tweak from the default configuration
to satisfy my needs.

* Package Settings
Now we have a series of package-specific settings. There is no
particular order, but some package might have dependency on others, or
modify the behavior of others. In the later case, I try to state
explicitly in the text that cross modification happens, otherwise it
would be a headache to keep track of all the inter-dependencies.

** Paradox
Paradox is a package manager which is better than the built-in
one. This is simply a one-line config which enables access to github with tokens
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq paradox-github-token "99f28325b00944af3822a25547380279334b91a4")

** Yasnippet
Yasnippet is a snippet manager for Emacs. It works by expanding short
specific keywords into predetermined structures which are called
"snippets". For example, one can enter "src" in the =org-mode= buffer
and press =TAB=, and yasnippet will expand "src" into the standard
=org-mode= source block "#+BEGIN_SRC ... #+END_SRC". It is very handy
when entering repetitive code blocks or structures, and minimizes
mistakes in the process.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package yasnippet 
    :init
    (progn
      (defun yas-advise-indent-function (function-symbol)
        (eval `(defadvice ,function-symbol (around yas/try-expand-first activate)

** Ace-jump mode
This package is a fast way to jump to a target position in the
buffer. Once in the mode, one press a letter and all occurrence of the
letter in the buffer are highlighted with a unique label. One can then
enter the corresponding label to jump to the target position
precisely. This is faster than isearch mode especially when you can
already pin-point the place you want to go. It also has integration
with evil at [[ace-jump-evil][here]].
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package ace-jump-mode
    :config
    (progn
      ;; (eval-after-load "ace-jump-mode"
      (ace-jump-mode-enable-mark-sync)

      ;;Personally I like ace-jump to be limited to the window I’m working in
      (setq ace-jump-mode-scope 'window)))
#+END_SRC

** Ace-window
This package is a way to jump between frames using something similar
to ace-jump-mode. When there is only 2 windows open, this acts similar
to the vanilla =other-window= function which is bound to =C-x
o=. However, when there are more than 2 windows, a key will be shown
at the upper left corner and pressing the corresponding key will jump
to that window instantly, instead of looping over the available
windows like =other-window= does. It is great when there are a few
windows open and one wants to jump between them quickly, but its
efficiency is not so big when there are only 3 windows and one only
needs to be jumping between 2 of them. Maybe need further tinkering...
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package ace-window
      :init
      (global-set-key (kbd "M-s") 'ace-window) ; cursor to a given window

** Company-mode
This is an auto-complete framework for Emacs. There are two
auto-complete frameworks in the wild there right now. One is the
classic =auto-complete= which has been great but its programmer
interface is said to be not very good. The other is =company-mode=
which is short for "Complete-anything mode". I've been playing around
with these two and while I haven't made up my mind yet, the C++
completion by =company-mode= is currently having the upper hand. Here
is the config:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package company
    :init
    (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-company-mode)
    :config
    (progn
      (defun check-expansion ()
        (save-excursion
          (if (looking-at "\\_>") t
            (backward-char 1)
            (if (looking-at "\\.") t
              (backward-char 1)
              (if (looking-at "::") t
                ;; (backward-char 1)
                (if (looking-at "->") t nil))))))

      (defun do-yas-expand ()
        (let ((yas/fallback-behavior 'return-nil))
          (yas/expand)))

      (defun tab-indent-or-complete ()
        (interactive)
        (if (minibufferp)
            (minibuffer-complete)
          (if (or (not yas/minor-mode)
                  (null (do-yas-expand)))
              (if (check-expansion)
                  (company-complete-common)
                (indent-for-tab-command)))))

      (global-set-key (kbd "TAB") 'tab-indent-or-complete)
      (defun my-setup-company ()
        (setq company-backends (delete 'company-semantic company-backends))
        (setq company-backends (delete 'company-eclim company-backends))
        ;; (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-elisp)
        (use-package company-c-headers)
        (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-c-headers)

      )
      (add-hook 'company-mode-hook 'my-setup-company)
      ))
#+END_SRC

There is now a serious bug for =company-mode= which prevents me from
using it further. When =flyspell-mode= is on, the candidate list for
completion will sometimes not appear or cause the cursor to move to
weird places.

** Flyspell
Flyspell is an automatic spell checker that checks the English
spelling of words in the current buffer. It runs an instance of
=aspell= in the background. Note that this mode might have conflicts
with =auto-complete= or =company-mode=. There is a workaround for the
former, but it is not clear if there is a solution for the later.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package flyspell
    :init
    (progn
      (dolist (hook '(text-mode-hook))
        (add-hook hook (lambda () (flyspell-mode 1))))
      (dolist (hook '(change-log-mode-hook log-edit-mode-hook))
        (add-hook hook (lambda () (flyspell-mode -1))))
      (dolist (hook '(c++-mode-hook python-mode-hook haskell-mode-hook emacs-lisp-mode-hook))

    :config
    (progn
      (setq flyspell-issue-message-flag nil)))
#+END_SRC

** Auto-complete
Again, I'm swaying between =company-mode= and =auto-complete= and here
is my configuration for =auto-complete=. This is a configuration that
is known to work, and currently has less bug than =company-mode=.

Projectile is a project management package for Emacs. It has nice
project navigation and integration with other packages. Here is
actually a minimal setting with integration with helm.

** Magit
=magit= is the best git wrapper, period. It is actually better than
the official git interface, since the command line interface is a
headache for most people. Magit makes interacting with git a
breeze. The config is very simple too:

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c g") 'magit-status))
#+END_SRC

** Undo-tree
Undo tree is a way to keep track of undo history using a tree-like
structure. It is integrated with evil-mode so that is a bonus as
well. The settings here basically turns it on everywhere, asks it to
save history into a file, and apply compression on that file.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** LaTeX
Rather than a LaTeX package, there are quite a few packages working
together here to provide the superior Emacs LaTeX editing
experience. First is the =cdlatex.el= which is actually maintained
outside of our package repos. The newest version is 4.6 which can be
found [[https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/c.dominik/Tools/cdlatex/cdlatex.el][here]]. I assume in this config file that the newest version is
already downloaded at =~/.emacs.d/cdlatex/=

** Semantic mode
This section turns on Semantic mode globally. This might cause
slow-downs and other hazards for Emacs, but semantic mode remains one
of the best code analyze solutions in Emacs.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (use-package cc-mode)
  (use-package semantic

Since we use semantic mode, it is good to also enable function-args
mode which is a good way to show inline function hint for C/C++
languages.

** EDE Projects
First we enable EDE mode globally.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no

#+END_SRC

Here we define projects for EDE mode. This is necessary for Semantic

especially C++.

First we turn on Flycheck for all buffers
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC

Now add google c++ style checker

** Smart Parens Mode
Simply turns on smart parens mode globally.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'smartparens-config)
  (smartparens-global-mode t)

  ;; Hightlight matching pairs
  (show-smartparens-global-mode t)
#+END_SRC

* Language modes
These are less specific settings than the above section, oriented not
to a package but to a language mode. Each subsection might contain
multiple small packages that works together to make the language mode more useful.

** C/C++/Cuda mode
First make =.h= files use C++ mode instead of C mode
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Treat all .h files as c++ files
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.h\\'" . c++-mode))

* Custom File
Emacs has a built-in customization interface. All the customizations
done through it will be saved in the init file in a rather ugly form,
and it is suggested that the user should not to modify that
section. Since our init file is tangled from this org file, we want to
keep that customization file separate. This can be done as follows:

Because customizations usually involves package specifics, we want to
defer this block to the end of the initialization process. A side
effect is that if the init process is somehow interrupted by an error,
Emacs will not be able to see this file, therefore not able to write
custom configs. This kind of behavior signals an error in one of the
previous parts of initialization process, and you should examine it
carefully to see where the problem is.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
